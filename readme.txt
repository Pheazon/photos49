This project was done by Haseeb Balal (hhb10) and Muffadal Hussain (mmh2410). We first started with the login controller which is the first place the program goes to when launched. This is where the a user can create a new user or login as a user or admin. From there if the user was an admin they will go to the admin view where the admin can create new users and delete users. If a user logins to the login controller they will go to the user view where a user can create an album, delete an album, rename an album, open an album and search. If a user opens an album they will go to the album view where the user pictures are. A user can add a picture with a caption, tag name  and tag value. A user also has the ability to move and copy picture. From here if a users clicks on slideshow, it will take them to the slideshow controller where there can preview all the pictures in an album. If from the user view a user wants to search it will take them to the searchview controller where they can search for picture by date or by tags. We also had to create some models, we had models for user, images, albums and table rows for collecting and displaying data. This project also required sterilization so that also had to be implemented	in all the models and the main required a read and write method to save the data in or dat folder as data.dat. The final uml and storyboard is in the docs folder in the project. The final storyboard did change slightly from the initial storyboard but there shouldnâ€™t be big changes made. We did not change the inputs to all uppercase or lowercase. When the user does not input an a correct url it does not take it but it does not crash. It will give some errors and thats it.
